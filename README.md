# Strategic Transport Planning Dataset

A graph based strategic transport planning dataset, aimed at creating the next generation of deep graph neural networks in transfer learning situations. Based on simulation results of the Four Step Model in PTV Visum.

Details of the work as well as results can be found in the thesis ["Development of a Deep Learning Surrogate for the Four-Step Transportation Model"](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1638691/dwz10x0l0w38xdklv9zkrprqs.pdf).




## Problem Setting

The aim of strategic transport planning is to do long term predictions of a given city, based purely on the underlying transport network and socioecenomic data. The socioeconomic data of every household is grouped into so called zones. To solve the problem the model needs to both understand how socioeconomic data creates demand as well as it is applied to the supply side of the network. In practise, this is usually solved by the [4 Step Model](https://www.transitwiki.org/TransitWiki/index.php/Four-step_travel_model), however it has a number of downsides including requiring a large amount of manual work to calibrate and slow prediction speed.

This problem is a great task for deep graph neural networks. However, there is no large public dataset available, so we propose to generate data using in a surrogate model setup, using the 4 Step Model as the baseline. The problem is a transfer learning for GNNs. Within this project, the aim is to create a proof of concept, with all generated cities having between 15 and 80 nodes, and 3-10 zones. Details can be found in [thesis](https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1638691/dwz10x0l0w38xdklv9zkrprqs.pdf).


## Data Generation

**Augmented Dataset**
- Extract random subnetworks from processed OpenStreetMaps and procedural generation for socioeconomic data
- 6398 training samples, 1600 validation samples, 2000 test samples

**Synthetic Dataset**
- Procedural generation for both network and socioeconomic data
- +9995 training samples


The dataset ```1_classification_simple``` uses exclusively the augmented dataset. Both ```2_classification_hard``` and ```3_regression``` use the augmented dataset for training, validation and test sets, but also add the synthetic dataset for additional training samples. All problems use identical validation and test datasets, with the targets transformed to the respective task.


## Data Transformation

- The datasets presented have all input features standardized and filtered as needed
- As most common GNNs can only do simulatenous predictions for nodes, all edges are transformed into nodes, thus requiring masking during training
    - Irrelevant node/edge features are then set to 0

All details can be found in the thesis above.
